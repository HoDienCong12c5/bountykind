# React Gradient Text (rgt)

After finding myself adding this kind of gradient colors on text across multiple different projects, I got tired of having to re-write my own react gradient text components on each project, and so I decided to create a tiny and extremely simple and lightweight component that can be used in any project. It simply wraps whatever text children are passed to it in a `<span>` tag that applies a linear gradient to it.

The goal is to be able to use a Gradient component across any project to give a color gradient style to any kind of text the following way:

```jsx
import react from 'react'
import Gradient from 'rgt'
import Text from 'UI-Library'

const Component = () => <>
    <h1>
        <Gradient dir="top-to-bottom" from="#5F3BB7" to="#55D4FF">
            You can wrap text that goes inside an html text component
        </Gradient>
    </h1>
    <Text>
        <Gradient dir="top-to-bottom" from="#5F3BB7" to="#55D4FF">
            But you can also wrap text that goes into a custom react text component
        </Gradient>
    </Text>
    <a>
        <Gradient dir="top-to-bottom" from="#5F3BB7" to="#55D4FF">
            You can even apply these styles to a link!
        </Gradient>
    </a>
</>

```



# Installation

Currently available on npm, you can just run the following to install this lightweight dependency into your project.

`npm install rgt`



# Usage

We have already seen a few examples of how the Gradient component can be used. However, what can I pass as props, you maye be asking yourself?
